# Smart-Medicine-Box
Final year project 

## Develop a smart/intelligent medicine box with a web
application for the patient that will allow the
user/patient to securely store and monitor the
medication inventory, create reminders for taking the
medicines, and manage daily tasks.

# FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCT
## The revenue model of an IoT medicine box can be based on a few different approaches. Here
are some potential revenue models:
1.
Product Sales:
The IoT medicine box can be sold as a standalone product to customers,
generating revenue through product sales. The revenue can be based on the unit price of the
medicine box, which can vary depending on the features, functionality, and manufacturing
costs.
2.
Subscription Model:
Another potential revenue model is to offer the IoT medicine box on a
subscription basis. This would involve customers paying a monthly or yearly fee to use the
device, which could include ongoing updates, maintenance, and support. This model would
provide a recurring revenue stream for the company.
